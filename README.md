# goodreads-Data

I've been learning how to use python to parse through data and get valuable statistics. Because I use GoodReads a lot, I wanted to use my data to play around with data analytics and graphs.  

In my jupyter notebook, the coolest thing was that I was able to visualize how many pages I have been reading each month in 2022 and 2023. I can compare my progress in the double bar graph to see how I am doing since last year. 

I also took the opportunity to figure out when my books were published/where my general interest lies! I found that majority of the books I have logged are from the 2010's, but there is also a decent amount of books from the 20th century.
